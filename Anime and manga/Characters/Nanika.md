# Nanika - Power Analysis (Hunter x Hunter)

## [Power 1]: Absolute Wish Granting  
Nanika can grant any wish as long as the price (requests) is paid. The granted effects have no defined limit — she restored Gon’s Nen and body after he was mortally crippled.  

## [Power 3]: Non-Nen Based Power  
Nanika operates *independently of Nen rules*. Her powers seem tied to a supernatural source — the Dark Continent entity “Ai”.  
*As stated in* Beyond Netero’s expedition log, these entities defy standard Nen systems.  
- **Implication**: She cannot be countered, canceled, or blocked using Nen defense. Even the Zoldycks are terrified of her mysterious ability.  

## [Power 4]: Emotion-Based Control  
- **Implication**: Power control can be bypassed or weaponized based on relationship dynamics.

## [Power 5]: Reality Warping  
Her power transcends physical or logical constraints.  
- **Example**: Revived someone from a condition beyond death-like near total life force loss.  
- **Power Scale**: Comparable to top-tier hax characters. This kind of reality override places her above Dragon-level beings in many series.

# One-Punch Man Threat Level

## Classification: **GOD-Level Threat**  
- **Why**: Nanika is capable of *instant global-scale danger* via reality-altering wishes.  
- Can bypass all known physical defense (Tanktop Master, Tatsumaki, etc. are meaningless against her).
