# Character ranking includes:
* A structured format for analyzing character powers and abilities.
* Analysing character stats
* Focuses on using evidence from the anime/manga/source material.
* Attempts to provide TNT calculations for destructive feats when possible.

### AI usage:
*Generally I will avoid AI usage, but if I do use any I will strictly follow this prompt:*
```
Character: [Insert Character Name Here]
Anime/Manga/Source: [Insert Anime/Manga/Source Here]
Power Analysis:
Please tell me about all their amazing powers, abilities and stats. Give me examples from the anime, manga, or original source to show just how powerful they are. Do NOT add "evidence:" or similar to your showcase, instead add "as stated in-". For the most powerful powers “Character” has, try to find specific scenes or moments that prove how strong they really are, also add a calculation in TNT if possible. If “Character” has specific attributes that stick out like intelligence, please include such attributes as well.

Example:
“
[Power 1]: [Explanation and evidence]
[Power 2]: [Explanation and evidence]
[Power 3]: [Explanation and evidence]
“
One-Punch Man Threat Level:
Now, imagine “Character” suddenly appeared in the world of One-Punch Man and wanted to cause trouble! Based on their powers, what threat level would the Hero Association give them? Would they be a Wolf, Tiger, Demon, Dragon, or even God level threat?
Please explain why you think they would fit that level. Use the evidence from their powers and stats  to back up your answer.

Text:
Please use as little text as possible, I want a deep analysis and not an essay.
