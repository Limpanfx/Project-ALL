# Character ranking includes:
* A structured format for analyzing character powers and abilities.
* Analysing character stats
* Focuses on using evidence from the anime/manga/source material.
* Attempts to provide TNT calculations for destructive feats when possible.

One punch man [threat levels](https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Disaster_levels):
Wolf: Any potential threat that poses a danger to an unknown degree.
Tiger: Any threat to a large number of people.
Demon: Any threat to a city and its people.
Dragon: Any threat to multiple cities.
God: A threat endangering the survival of humanity in general.

### AI usage:
*Generally I will avoid AI usage, but if I do use any I will strictly follow this prompt:*
```
Character: [Insert Character Name Here]
Anime/Manga/Source: [Insert Anime/Manga/Source Here]
Power Analysis:
Please tell me about all their amazing powers, abilities and stats. Give me examples from the anime, manga, or original source to show just how powerful they are. Do NOT add "evidence:" or similar to your showcase what chapter, timestamp or location in the source the information is gathered from, instead mention the situation (eg. "Neferpitou compares his new aura to equal value of the king's" as evidence). For the most powerful powers “Character” has, try to find specific scenes or moments that prove how strong they really are, also add a calculation of TNT power if possible. If “Character” has specific attributes that stick out like intelligence, please include such attributes as well.

Example:
“
[Power 1]: [Explanation and evidence]
[Power 2]: [Explanation and evidence]
[Power 3]: [Explanation and evidence]
“

One-Punch Man Threat Level:
Now, imagine “Character” suddenly appeared in the world of One-Punch Man and wanted to cause trouble! Based on their powers, what threat level would the Hero Association give them? Would they be a Wolf, Tiger, Demon, Dragon, or even God level threat?
Please explain why you think they would fit that level. Use the evidence from their powers and stats to back up your answer. Follow the format below when writing about this.

Threat level format:
“
## Classification: **Dragon-Level Threat**
- Reasoning: [Explanation and evidence]
- Limitations: [Explanation and evidence]
- Considerations: [Explanation and evidence]
“

Do not seperate like this:
“
## One-Punch Man Threat Level

### Classification: **Dragon-Level Threat**
“

Text in general:
Please use as little text as possible, I want a deep analysis and not an essay. Make sure it is written like a ".md" file. Keep in mind that this is only a model/prompt for multiple characters. So if one of these requirements can't be met using "Character", skip it. Do not include any -'s or similar to seperate, instead indicate text parts by # function in .md files.
