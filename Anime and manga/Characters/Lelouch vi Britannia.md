# Lelouch vi Britannia (Code Geass)

## Powers, Abilities, and Stats

**[Power 1]: Geass - "The Power of Absolute Obedience"**  
- Can issue a single, irresistible command to any individual via eye contact.    
- Controlled entire armies and nations by targeting key individuals (e.g., ordering guards to kill themselves, generals to change strategies).  
- Instant mental domination, cannot be resisted once eye contact is made, even by trained or strong-willed individuals.  

**[Power 4]: Political Control Over Superweapons**  
- Gained access to the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead, capable of vaporizing entire cities (estimated yield: 25-50 kilotons TNT).  
- Used F.L.E.I.J.A. to force global superpowers to surrender or align with his new world order.  

### Classification: **Dragon-Level Threat**
- **Reasoning**: Lelouchâ€™s Geass allows for instant control over anyone with eye contact, including heroes and S-Class threats. His tactical mind could manipulate entire factions into civil war or turn heroes against each other.
- **Limitations**: Geass only works once per person, and requires direct eye contact. He is physically weak and vulnerable without strategic preparation.
- **Considerations**: While not physically strong, Lelouch could become a God-level threat if given time and resources to influence world politics, gain superweapons, or manipulate S-Class heroes from the shadows.
