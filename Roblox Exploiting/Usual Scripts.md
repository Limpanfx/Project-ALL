# *Walkspeed*
- **Bypassed**
```lua
getgenv().Enabled = true -- change to false then execute again to turn off
getgenv().Speed = 100 -- change speed to the number you want
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipsology/SimpleSpeed/main/SimpleSpeed.lua"))()
```
- **Regular**
```lua
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character:WaitForChild("Humanoid").WalkSpeed = 100
```
