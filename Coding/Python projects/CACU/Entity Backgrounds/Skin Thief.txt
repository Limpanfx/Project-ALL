A quiet, isolated village along the banks of Frozen Point Lake on the northwestern side of Cosmatora has over several years, suffered a string of unexplained disappearances. The incidents were believed to be unrelated, local reports however began highlighting a disturbing trend: individuals exhibiting odd, disconnected behavior shortly before vanishing. 

Early assumptions suggested the victims themselves were acting abnormally. However, with new data, CACU now firmly believes the abnormality was not the victim, but rather the entity pretending to be human.

CACU was initially contacted after the fourth confirmed disappearance. Upon investigation, no detectable anomalous phenomenon was recorded. Case was classified as non-anomalous and closed under Cold Status.

However, CACU now strongly suspects the presence of a mimetic entity. The entity, now codenamed “Skinthief”, is believed to murder victims and wear their skin to fabricate a life as a human. This allows it to move freely within the population until decomposition of the skin forces another kill.

Locals have suffered socially due to heightened paranoia. Trust among villagers is now functionally nonexistent.
