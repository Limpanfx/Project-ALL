In the southeastern region of Cosmatora, a fragmented humanoid entity was spotted emerging from a scorching hole within the base of a tree. Witnesses described it as if the tree had been hollowed out by something burning from the inside. The creature did not respond to communication or stimuli and appeared devoid of thought or awareness. Wherever it wandered, the surrounding area ignited. Grass, trees, plants, structures, even stone all turned into a black ash after only a few seconds.

Attempts of stopping or containing the being all failed. Traditional weaponry was ineffective due to the extreme temperatures surrounding it, and early CACU squads were forced to withdraw, leaving the entity to wander free. The entity wandered without direction, seemingly immune to damage and uninterested in its surroundings, yet leaving a trail of ruin and torment.

Defeated CACU decided to investigate the hole it originated from.  The hole soon enough revealed some disturbing details: the tunnel descended for miles, becoming increasingly hot the deeper it went, to the point where exploration became physically impossible. The walls of the tunnel were uneven and contained fist-shaped impressions, suggesting that the passage had been carved out manually, over an unimaginable span of time.
After cross-referencing ancient records, CACU researchers proposed a theory: the being may have come from a mythical location known only as “Hell,” believed to exist at the core of the world. According to ancient script fragments, those condemned by poor karma are cast into this subterranean inferno like area. People who reach the place upon death are granted immortality as a curse rather than a gift. Locked in burning isolation, such beings endure endless torment.

This entity, it’s believed, is one such soul having clawed its way up through the earth over tens of thousands of years. By the time it reached the surface, its mind had shattered, its body changed by the intense heat and suffering. The relentless burning it carries is a byproduct of the place it came from. It is no longer seen as a weapon, but a condition.

Now code-named “Ash Born”, the being has since been captured using specially developed solar-grade equipment designed to withstand temperatures equivalent to the sun’s surface. It is currently held in a subterranean heat-proof containment chamber. Ongoing studying remains limited due to the extreme precautions required to avoid total incineration.
