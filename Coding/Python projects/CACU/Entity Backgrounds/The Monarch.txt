Deep beneath the frozen mountains in the belighted caves of the north, the hidden city of Khan-No once thrived. But when their king Khan was murdered and no successor stepped forward, the city fell into chaos. Law vanished and crime became a norm.

Desperate for a solution, the villagers turned to old dark traditions. They sacrificed the king’s murderer in a forgotten tunnel, drawing with his blood the symbol that represents the village. As a result something in deep slumber awoke. Man nor god, but a demon sent from a devil’s palm. It rose wearing no crown, for the crown symbolising superiority was embedded in its skull.

That night, a new ruler took the throne. The Monarch.

The demon brought with it the promise of control. But its intention was not hospitality. With golden eyes that no one could resist, it issued commands that no one could deny. Those it looked upon followed its will as if it were their own. Resistance was impossible. That night the freedom the villagers once had vanished and enslavement replaced it.

The city grew quiet again. Peace returned, but at the cost of choice. Those who once prayed for justice now served without question, puppets held by the Monarch’s stare.

It is now known in CACU records as “The Monarch”, an entity born of blood and desperation, ruling with the power of the absolute. To see its eyes is to surrender.  Once it has seen you, you are no longer your own.
