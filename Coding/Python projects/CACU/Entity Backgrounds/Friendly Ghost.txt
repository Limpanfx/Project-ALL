The Friendly-Ghost has no visible form. It is not invisible in the sense of hiding. It simply does not possess an appearance: no face, no shape, no shadow. Yet its presence can be noticed through small, soothing signs:

A soft rhythmic sound like gentle snoring. It sounds like one smooth breath, followed by a short, interrupted one, repeating softly like a sleepy lullaby.

A feeling of calmness spreads through the air near the ghost where anxiety fades, nightmares vanish, and even children prone to restlessness often fall asleep peacefully when itâ€™s near.

Pets will often act as if someone gentle is nearby: dogs resting calmly without tension, cats curling up and purring.

The Friendly-Ghost will only attach to the first person it notices after 20:00. From that moment on, it will follow them wherever they go until 10:00 the next morning before vanishing.

Anyone within a 100-meter radius of the ghost is protected from all evil including unintentional. That includes strangers, family, animals and all other beings.
